## Description
### Overview
Intelligent Parking Assistant is a platform that can empower any existing car park of increasing parking capacity, and also can enable users to find and leave from a parking bay with just TWO TAPs!

The goal of the project is to solve the problem of parking spaces shortage without physically expanding a car park. We introduce the concept of "flexible parking spaces", and utilize algorithms and apps to complete intelligent parking scheduling, guidance, and management.

### User Story
As an employee of a company whose site is far away from my home, I need to drive to a to the office every day. Thinking ahead about where to park and in many cases don't know if there is still an available bay. It wastes a lot of time finding a bay after entering the site car park. However, after using this platform, we can open the parking reservation when approaching the destination, find the nearest parking space and navigate to the destination autonomously, which can save us a lot of time. Besides, there is also a reservation mechanism to ensure that the parking space will not be occupied during the period. Also, this will empower the utilization of idle parking resources in the same site.
